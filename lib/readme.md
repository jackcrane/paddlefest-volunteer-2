# Each `lib` standard is to:

1. Be housed within a single folder
2. Export 5 functions, loosely following the `CRUD` system

- `create`
- `read`
- `readAll`
- `update`
- `delete`

3. Have tests defined in `__tests__` folder.
4. Tests should cover all functions and should have at least 75% coverage.
