				Assumption of Risk and Waiver
				<br /><br />
				Volunteers with Adventure Crew agree to participate in activities that involve some level of
				risk of personal injury. Despite careful preparation and instruction, not all hazards can be
				foreseen. Each volunteer is solely responsible for determining if he/she is physically fit
				and/or properly skilled for any volunteer activities. It is understood that depending upon
				the volunteer service, the volunteer may assume certain risks to include, but not limited
				to, inclement weather, slips and falls, premises defects, carelessness, heavy lifting,
				injury, equipment and tools, motor vehicles and all other circumstances inherent to each and
				all volunteer AC adventures. Volunteers always have the right to refuse a task that makes
				them uncomfortable and/or refrain from participating in any given adventure or its
				particular activity elements.
				<br /><br />
				To the fullest extent permitted by law, I agree to assume the reasonable risk of
				participation in the activities for which I agree to volunteer. In consideration of being
				permitted to participate in the volunteer adventure, I agree to defend and hold harmless,
				Adventure Crew, against any and all claims, demands, suits, losses, including all costs
				connected therewith, for any damage which may be asserted, claimed or recovered against or
				from Adventure Crew and its Board of Directors, employees, partners and all other related
				entities and organizations, by reason of personal injury and death; and property damage,
				including loss of use thereof, which arises out of the alleged negligence of Adventure Crew,
				or in any way connected to or associated with any and all AC volunteer activities and
				adventures. I agree to follow the directions of Adventure Crew and exercise reasonable care
				in all activities in which I participate. I have taken all precautions for my health, to
				include an annual appointment with my physician whereby I feel comfortable participating in
				AC adventures.
				<br /><br />
				Additionally, I give full permission to Adventure Crew and their partners/sponsors use of
				all photos, videos and/or other recordings of me that are made during the course of an AC
				Adventure; I understand use includes all electronic and print related mediums strategic to
				the promotion of AC and/or its affiliates.
